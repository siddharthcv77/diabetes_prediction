## Description

Imagine being able to predict the likelihood of someone having diabetes based on certain health measurements. In this project, you'll dive into a real-world medical dataset and build a simple predictive model using Python. By learning to preprocess data, split it into training and testing sets, and train a machine learning model, you'll take your first steps into the world of predictive analytics. This project will provide you with valuable hands-on experience in data preprocessing and basic machine learning techniques, setting the foundation for more advanced projects in the future.

## Run

`python main.py [model]`
model: linear_regression decision_tree
